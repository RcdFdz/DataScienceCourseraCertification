#### Description and goals
Investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Using lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations this paper will focus on investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. 

Will be Illustrated via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials.

For this aim this paper will be divided in 3 topics:

1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

#### Simulation
In order to create the dataset we will run a serie of 1000 simulations with 40 sampling size (observations) and as has been mentioned before the expoential distribution set to ```rexp(40, 0.2)```. Following the code:

For an easier overview we can plot the sample:

#### Sample mean and the theoretical mean of the distribution

As is shown bellow the value of the sample mean is `5.058108` and the theoretical is `5`. The mean of exponential distribution and the theoretical mean of the distribution are quite close.

From the sample:

```
# actual mean of the sample data
mean_sample <- mean(sample)
```
```
> mean_sample
[1] 5.058108
```
Theoretical:

```
# theoretical mean
theoretical_mean <- 1/lambda 
```
```
> theoretical_mean
[1] 5
```

#### Variability, sample variance compared to the theoretical variance of the distribution

As is shown bellow the value of the sample variance is `0.6435606` and the theoretical is `0.625`, this results implies that the mean from the sample is very close to the theoretical mean of normal data.

From the sample:

```
# variance for the sample data 
sample_variance <- var(sample)
```

```
> sample_variance 
[1] 0.6435606
```
Theoretical:

```
# theorical_variance
theoretical_variance <- (1/lambda)^2/observations
```
```
> theoretical_variance 
[1] 0.625
```

Bellow a graphical overview of both means and variances and its code:

#### Distribution approximately normal

In order to prove that the distribution is approximately normal, first we will create a histogram with a normal distribution and see how fits with the sample. Bellow the code and graph:

Based on the above graph, we can conclude that the distribution of the sample mean can be considered as a normal distributed.

#### Confidence interval
Following we will compare the 95% confidence interval for both and prove that they are quite close.
From the sample:

```
sample_ci <- round (mean(sample) + c(-1,1)*1.96*sd(sample)/sqrt(observations),3)
```
```
> sample_ci
[1] 4.809 5.307

```
Theoretical:

```
theoretical_ci <- theoretical_mean + c(-1,1)*1.96*sqrt(theoretical_variance)/sqrt(observations)
```
```
> theoretical_ci
[1] 4.755 5.245
```
Based on the results we can conclude that the confidence interval for the sample mean `[4.809, 5.307]` and the theoretical confidence interval `[4.755, 5.245]` are quite close.

#### Normal Q-Q Plot Quantiles
Finally the Normal Q-Q plot for quantiles that shows the density computed using the histogram and the normal density plotted with theoretical mean and variance values.

#### Concusions

Considering the above results for mean (sample: 5.058108, theoretical: 5), variance (Sample: 0.6435606, Theoretical: 6.25), the distribution, confidence interval (sample: [4.809, 5.307], theoretical: [4.755, 5.245]) and the Normal Q-Q Plot we can conclude that the distribution of the sample data is approximately normaly distributed.
